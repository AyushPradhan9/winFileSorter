# Window's File Sorter (winFileSorter)
Window's File Sorter (winFileSorter) is an automation python (GUI/Tkinter) program for sorting files based on their extension into appropriate folders. It is developed for people having clumsy desktop for a more cleaner and efficient usage of resources. It is divided into two types of sorting - Dynamic and Static sorting and it also generates a listFiles.txt file at the targeted folder to give an overview over the sorted files.
## Getting Started
The program (winFileSorter.exe) is placed in the folder that is to be sorted and is then executed. The file then show two options whether to sort the current files placed in the same folder or sort the upcoming files that will be updated in the folder.
## Updates

- Timestap is also saved in the listFiles.txt file to keep record.
## Functionalities
- Sort random file into appropriate folder based on their extension.
- Static sorting (Sort current files) can be done for sorting the files currently in the file.
- Dynamic sorting (Continue sorting upcoming file) can be done for sorting the upcoming files in the target folder. (Can be used for sorting the Downloads folder)
- Generates listFiles.txt file to give an overview of the files placed of current target folder, files sorted and to which folder.
## Note
- Using the dynamic sorting (sorting upcoming files) will require the program to be kept running while the files are being updated.
