# Window's File Sorter (winFileSorter)
Window's File Sorter (winFileSorter) is an automation python (GUI) program for sorting files based on their extension into appropriate folders. It is developed for people having clumsy desktop for a more cleaner and efficient usage of resources. It is divided into two types of sorting - Dynamic and Static sorting and it also generates a listFiles.txt file at the targeted folder to give an overview over the sorted files.
## Getting Started
The program (winFileSorter.exe) is placed at the folder that is to be sorted and is executed. The file then show two options whether to sort the current files placed in the same folder or sort the upcoming files that will be updated in the folder.
## How to use
Place the winFileSorter.exe file to the folder to be sorted and run the program.
## Functionalities
- Sort random file into appropriate folder based on their extension.
- Static sorting (Sort current files) can be done for sorting the files currently in the file.
- Dynamic sorting (Sort upcoming file) can be done for sorting the upcoming files in the target folder. (Can be used for sorting the Downloads folder)
- Generates listFiles.txt file to give an overview of the structure of current target folder, files sorted and to which folder.
## Note
- Using the dynamic sorting (sorting upcoming files) will require the program to be kept running while the files are being updated.
- Name of the executable file (winFileSorter.exe) shouldn't be changed. If changed, will make the program itself to be sorted and will be placed under the executable folder.
